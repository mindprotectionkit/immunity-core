What Can I Do To Protect Myself?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we were talking about how to defend yourself against subpoenas and
search warrants, we said, **“If you don’t have it, they can’t get it.”**

Of course, that’s only partially true: if you don’t have it, they can’t
get it *from you*. But that doesn’t mean they might not be able to get
copies of your communications or detailed records about them from
someone else, such as your communications service providers or the
people and services that you communicate with. Indeed, as we outlined in
the last section, it’s much *easier* as a legal matter for the
government to obtain information from these third parties — often
without probable cause or any notice to you. 

So, you also need to
remember this lesson: **“If someone else has stored it, they can get
it.”** If you let a third party store your voicemail or email, store
your calendar and contacts, back up your computer, or log your
communications traffic, that information will be relatively easy for the
government to secretly obtain, especially compared to trying it to get
it from you directly. So, we’ll discuss in this section how to minimize
the content that you store with third parties. 

We’ve also asked you to
**“encrypt, encrypt, encrypt!”** in the previous sections about
protecting data on your computer and while you are communicating. The
same holds true when protecting against the government getting your
information from other people. Although ideally you will avoid storing
sensitive information with third parties, using encryption to protect
the data that you do store — such as the emails you store with your
provider, or the files you back up online — can provide a strong line of
defense. We’ll talk in this section about how to do that.

Communications content that you’ve chosen to store with a service
provider isn’t the only issue, though. There are also the records that
those third parties are creating about your interactions with their
services. Practically everything you do online will create records, as
will your phone calls. So your best defense is to **think before you
communicate:**

-  Do you really want the phone company to have a record of this call —
   who you called, when, and how long you talked?
-  Do you really want a copy of this email floating around in the
   recipient’s inbox, or on your or his email provider’s system?
-  Do you really want your cell phone provider to have a copy of that
   embarrassing SMS text message?
-  Do you really want Google to know that you’re searching for *that*?

It may be that the communication is so trivial or the convenience so
great that you decide that the risk is worth it. But think about it —
seriously consider the security trade-offs and make a decision — before
you press “send”. We’ll give you information in this section that should
help you make those decisions. 

Another option for minimizing the
information that’s recorded about you — short of avoiding using a
service altogether — is to **protect your anonymity using encryption and
anonymous communication tools.** If you want to search Google or browse
Amazon without them being able to log information that the government
could use to identify you, you’ll need to use software such as
`Tor`_\ to hide your IP address, as well as carefully manage your
browser’s privacy settings. This section will give you the information
you need to do that.

Choosing a Communications Method
================================

Again, Telephone Calls are Your Safest Bet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When it comes to protecting the privacy of communications content stored
by your provider, the safest choice is to avoid storing any content with
the provider *at all*. Therefore, just as when we were discussing
wiretapping, regular old telephone calls have a distinct advantage over
other communications methods: putting aside voicemail, which we’ll
discuss on the next page, telephone calls *don’t create copies*. That
means, unless the government goes to the technical and legal trouble of
directly wiretapping you (a very low risk, compared to the government
trying to obtain stored copies of your communications), or the person
you are talking to is so untrustworthy that they would record your
conversation without telling you (a rarity, but it does sometimes
occur), your telephone call will be safe from prying ears. 

As you’ll see
on the following pages, telephone calls are far preferable to SMS text
messages, which providers apparently store for long periods of time, and
which are very difficult to encrypt. IM and VOIP are better
alternatives, as we’ll also discuss, since they can be more easily
encrypted, and since instant messages and VOIP call contents are
typically not logged by providers. Email is a harder case, since it
necessarily creates a range of copies — with providers and with
recipients — but as you’ll see later, there are a number of steps you
can take to make that mode of communication safer, too.




Getting Started
===============

Learn What Your Service Providers Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most communications service providers and commercial web sites have
privacy policies. Read them to find out:

-  **What information do they collect?** It may be more than you think.
   If anyone you do business with doesn’t have a privacy policy (or
   their policy is unclear), you should contact them and ask about what
   they collect.
-  **With whom do they share it?** Most companies will share your
   information with other companies in their corporate family and with
   marketers; many companies will sell your data to anyone who wants it.
   Check to see if they’ll let you “opt-out” of sharing your information
   with other companies.
-  **What about the government?** Look in the privacy policy to see
   under what circumstances they’ll hand your information over to the
   government. Try to do business with companies that will not give your
   information to the government unless required by law to do so. Also
   find out whether they will notify you if the government asks for your
   files, and do business with companies who will always notify you
   unless prohibited by law from doing so. That way, you can call a
   lawyer and try to stop the disclosure before it happens.

Consider using activist-friendly, privacy-respecting communications
providers that offer free services. The `Online Policy Group`_, for
example, offers free web hosting and email list hosting, while `Rise
Up`_\ offers free email (including web-mail), web hosting, and email
list hosting. These services have strong privacy policies and will
notify you of any governmental or other attempt to seek customer
information unless prevented by law. Cable companies that offer Internet
access usually also have a policy of notifying you unless they’ve been
gagged — in fact, because of a quirky imbalance in the law, they
actually have to notify you if they can, unlike non-cable providers. So,
if you’re especially worried about the communications records held by
your ISP, consider using a cable broadband provider.

Online Storage of Your Private Data
===================================

Online Storage of Your Private Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There’s a lot of talk these days about how convenient it is to store
your data in the internet “cloud.” Why store your calendar or contacts
list or critical documents on one computer, or buy a hard drive to back
up your files at home, when you can store them “in the cloud” and access
them from anywhere using services like Google Calendar, or Google Docs,
or remote backup services that will store copies of all your files for
you? Well, here’s a reason: the government can easily subpoena that data
from those providers, with no notice to you. 

As we already described in
the “What Can The Government Do?” section, the communications stored by
your communications service providers are very weakly protected compared
to those you store yourself: after 180 days (or after you’ve downloaded
a copy, according to the DOJ), the government can get those
communications with only a subpoena and usually with no notice to you.
But the situation is even worse when it comes to data that you store
with someone other than your communications provider — so called “remote
computing services” (RCSs). Under the Stored Communications Act, the
government can obtain data that you send to an RCS for storage or
processing with only a subpoena regardless of how old it is, and
although the government is supposed to notify you before they do, the
law makes it very easy for investigators to delay that notice until
after they’ve gotten your data. 

Therefore, storing all that data
yourself, on your own computers — without relying on RCSs — is the most
legally secure way to handle your private information. If you do choose
to store copies of your files online, though, we strongly recommend
encrypting those files yourself before you do (visit our article on
`disk and file encryption`_ to learn how), or using services like
`IDrive`_ or `MozyPro`_ that give you the option of encrypting your
files using your own private encryption key.

Protecting Instant Messaging
============================

Major IM service providers like `AOL, Yahoo! And Microsoft say that they
don’t store your IM messages`_ after they are transmitted. Still
governments collect most Chats automatically. Use OTR-chat systems.
Never use Instant Messaging without encryption.

.. _AOL, Yahoo! And Microsoft say that they don’t store your IM messages: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15146186/



Protecting SMS
==============

Avoid Texting Sensitive Communications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major cell phone providers claim that they don’t log your SMS text
messages except for a very short period of time to ensure delivery (see,
*e.g.*, statements from providers in this news story entitled "`Most
Text Messages Are Saved Only Briefly`_\ ", or `another article`_
containing similar claims). However, there is reason to doubt these
claims: we’ve seen several cases where SMS messages were disclosed by a
provider months or even years after they were originally sent. For
example, as `USA Today`_ recounts, text messages were subpoenaed in the
Kobe Bryant rape case four months after they were sent, despite A&T
Wireless’ claims that customers’ text messages are deleted within 72
hours. According to that story, “How messages in the Bryant case would
be available four months later isn’t known; most likely they were
retrieved from an archival storage system.” Considering such incidents,
provider-side logging of your SMS text messages must be considered a
high risk. 

Furthermore, although we think that the Stored Communications
Act and the Fourth Amendment require the government in most cases to get
a warrant before obtaining your pager or SMS messages from your
provider, there are several known cases where it has obtained such
messages without warrants under the lower legal standards reserved for
non-content records, using only subpoenas.

Not only is there the threat of your provider logging your messages and
the government subpoenaing them, but also the near certainty that the
phones of the people you are communicating with are logging those
messages, adding yet another point of vulnerability. That’s in addition
to the logs on your own phone, which you should delete regularly based
on the `data retention policy`_ you developed after reading about “Data
Stored on Your Computer.” However, keep in mind that with the right
forensic tools, investigators will likely be able to recover even those
deleted messages if they ever get a hold of your phone, and the `Secure
Deletion`_ options for `Mobile Devices`_ are still quite limited.

Finally, although there have been some efforts at coming up with
encryption solutions that work for SMS (as described in our `Mobile
Devices`_ article), none of those techniques are easily or widely used.

Therefore, given the possibility that your SMS texts are logged by your
provider, that the government may be able to obtain those messages from
your provider without warrants and without notice to you, and that such
messages are hard if not impossible to encrypt, along with the certainty
that they will be logged on your phone and the phones of the people you
communicate with, we strongly recommend against using SMS for any
sensitive communications.

Protecting Your Email
=====================

Protecting Your Email Inbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Stored Communications Act requires the government to obtain a
warrant before seizing emails that are in “electronic storage” with your
communications provider and are less than 181 days old. However, under
the government’s interpretation of the term “electronic storage”, the
emails that arrive in your inbox lose warrant protection under the
Stored Communications Act, and are obtainable with nothing more than a
subpoena (often with no notice to you) as soon as you’ve downloaded,
opened, or otherwise viewed them. Similarly, the government believes
that it can obtain the sent emails and draft emails that you store with
your provider with only a subpoena, again often without notice to you;
the government doesn’t think those sent or draft emails are in
“electronic storage” as defined by the statute, either. EFF is doing
it’s best to prove the government’s interpretation wrong in court, and
some courts have already disagreed with the government. Yet as far as we
can tell, those court decisions haven’t significantly changed the
government’s behavior and it still routinely obtains opened emails (and
sent emails and draft emails) without warrants, regardless of how old
they are. Because of the government’s aggressive position, you need to
be just as aggressive when it comes to defending your email privacy. As
described on the next few pages, the most critical things you can do
are:

-  **Delete emails from your provider’s server as soon as you first
   access the messages,** and store your sent and draft emails locally
   in your email client software, rather than with your provider.
-  In order to minimize the number of emails stored with your provider —
   be they received, sent, or draft — **avoid using webmail if at all
   possible**, or, if you do use a webmail account, avoid the web
   interface and instead configure your email client software to send
   and receive emails directly via POP.
-  **Encrypt your emails** whenever possible.

Protecting Email: Download and Delete!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single most powerful step you can take to protect the privacy of
your email is to not store it with your email provider. Rather than
leave email on your provider’s server, you should configure your email
software to immediately delete incoming emails from your provider’s
server as you download those messages to your computer — and also make
sure that your email software is configured to store your draft and sent
email on your computer rather than with the provider. Of course, this is
a serious security/convenience trade-off — by fetching your email using
the “POP” email protocol and storing all your mail locally, you won’t
have access to your email from multiple devices like you would if you
were using the IMAP protocol or a webmail interface, both of which store
all of your mail with the provider. We realize that for some people,
particularly those without their own computer, using POP and storing
everything locally may not be an option. But if it is an option, and you
can effectively function without storing your emails with your provider,
we highly recommend doing so. For more, check out our `email article`_.

Protecting Email: Use Email Encryption When You Can
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using email encryption is a good idea even if you are storing all your
email locally, if only to counter the wiretapping threat. But using
encryption becomes all the more important if you are storing your email
content with your email provider. If the government comes calling on
your provider with a subpoena for your stored emails, you’ll wish you
had learned how to protect those messages with encryption, so visit our
`email article`_ and learn now!

.. _email article: https://ssd.eff.org/tech/email



Protecting Your Location Information
====================================

More on Cell Phone Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We described earlier how the government can enlist your phone company’s
help in tracking the location of your phone in real time. However,
that’s not the only location privacy threat posed by your cell phone:
your provider also keeps records of where your cell phone was each time
you made or received a phone call. 

In particular, phone companies
typically log the cell phone tower you were closest to when you called
someone or someone called you, as well as which “sector” of the tower’s
coverage area your phone was in. Particularly in urban environments
where there are lots of cell towers, such records can locate you with a
fairly high degree of precision, sometimes to within a city block or
even within a particular building. The government routinely obtains
these kinds of location records with only subpoenas and with no notice
to the target, although `EFF is working hard`_ to ensure that such data
can only be obtained with a search warrant. 

Unfortunately, there’s
nothing you can do to prevent these records from being created short of
not making phone calls, and turning your phone off to ensure that no one
calls you. Indeed, turning your phone off might be your only recourse —
particularly since some experts have advised us that the phone companies
not only log the location of your phone when a call is made but also log
the closest cell tower *whenever* your phone is turned on, as your phone
continuously registers itself with the cell network. 

Therefore, as is
true with every communications device that you use, your best defense is
to *think* before you use your cell phone. Do you *really* want your
phone company to have a log reflecting that you were in *that* part of
town at *that* time? If not, then you should turn the cell phone off.

Another potential solution is to anonymously purchase a prepaid cell
phone using cash. The phone company will still have the same location
data, but it won’t be as easily linked to your identity. Keep in mind,
however, that even if the phone company doesn’t have subscriber
information like your name and address, investigators might be able to
quickly associate you with the phone based on the people you communicate
with, or based on security camera footage from the store where you
bought the phone. 

For more information about the privacy risks posed by
cell phones, take a look at our article on `mobile devices`_. You may
also want to take a look at the advice offered by MobileActive.org in
its `Primer on Mobile Surveillance`_.

Protecting Your Search Privacy and Your Web Browsing Activity
=============================================================

The search history you generate when using search engines like Google or
Yahoo! reveals incredibly sensitive data about what you look at — or
even think of looking at — on the web. These logs may be tied to your
identity based on your IP address, the cookie files that the search
engine places on your computer, or your account information if you’ve
registered to use the search engine or other services offered by the
provider. And as discussed earlier in the “What Can the Government Do?”
section, these logs are subject to uncertain legal protections.

Considering the sensitivity of search logs and the questions surrounding
their legal status, we highly recommend that you exercise great care to
ensure that your identity cannot be linked to your search queries. For
an in-depth discussion of how to do that, read EFF’s "`Six Tips to
Protect Your Search Privacy`_\ ". You should also take a look at our
article on `browsers`_ to learn more about cookie management and on the
anonymizing software `Tor`_ to learn more about how to mask your IP
address. These same techniques can be used to protect you against
logging by any web site you visit, not just search engines, and we
recommend that you do use them whenever you visit a web site and don’t
want that site to log personally-identifying information about you and
the pages that you read. 

Finally, we recommend avoiding using one online
portal for multiple services — *e.g.*, try to avoid using Yahoo! Search
*and* Yahoo! Mail, or Google Search *and* Google Reader. Not only are
you making it easier for the search provider to identify you by virtue
of linking all of your activity to your personalized account, but you
are also offering the government a convenient “one-stop shop”
opportunity to access a wide range of your personal information at once.
Using these “mega-portals” to manage all aspects of your online life
might be convenient, but it also creates a single point of failure that
raises a serious security risk.

Protecting Your Voicemail
=========================

As we explained previously, copies of your communications stored by your
phone company such as your voicemail receive very weak legal protection
compared to copies of your communications stored in your own home. In
particular, after a communication has been stored more than 180 days —
or, according to the government’s reading of the law, after you’ve first
accessed that stored communication — the government no longer needs to
get a warrant before obtaining that communication, and can instead use
only a subpoena to the company (usually with no notice to you). When it
comes to your voicemail, this means two things:

-  Where possible, use your own answering machine or voicemail system,
   not the phone company’s.
-  Where it’s not possible to use your own answering machine or
   voicemail system, such as with your cell phone, you should always
   delete your voicemails as soon as you listen to them!
   


Summing Up
==========

Whenever you use technology to communicate, you will necessarily leave
traces of your activity with third parties like your phone company, your
ISP, or your search engine provider. If a third party has it, the
government can get it, often under weak legal standards and without any
notice to you. So remember:

-  **Think before you communicate.** Do you really want there to be a
   record of this?
-  **Choose to make a telephone call when you can**, rather than using
   SMS or the Internet, **unless your communications are encrypted**.
   Otherwise, there may be a record of the content of your communication
   on some third party’s server or in an archival database.
-  **Avoid storing your data with third parties when you can.** The
   records you store with others receive much less legal protection than
   those you store yourself.
-  **Use `file encryption`_ where possible** if you do choose to store
   data with an online service.
-  If you are using email or voicemail, **delete the copies stored by
   your communications provider as soon as you download or listen to
   them.**
-  **Learn how to hide your identity online** and minimize the
   information that online services log about you by learning how to
   configure your `browser`_ and use anonymizing technologies like
   `Tor`_.

Powerful new communications technologies carry with them powerful risks
to the privacy and security of your communications. Learn to defend
yourself!

TMI on the Web
==============

Do You Really Want to Publish that Blog Post, Flickr that Picture, or Broadcast that Facebook Status?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web is a powerful engine of personal expression, giving you a wide
variety of online venues to speak your mind and communicate with friends
or the public. But before you publish that blog post on MySpace or
Blogger, post a picture to a picture-sharing sites like Flickr or
Picasa, or broadcast your status on Facebook or using Twitter, think,
“Is this really information that you want to expose on the web?” Even if
you do now, think about years from now: will you want evidence of this
youthful indiscretion or that personal opinion floating around on the
web in the future? Remember, you don’t have any expectation of privacy
in information that you post to the public web, and information that you
post now but delete later may still persist, whether on the pages of the
friends you communicated with (like your Wall Posts to a friend on
Facebook), or in Google’s cache of old web pages, or the `Internet
Archive`_\ ’s library of public web pages. One way of limiting the risks
of posting information about yourself on the web is to use the privacy
settings offered by social sharing sites like Flickr or Facebook, with
which you can avoid publishing your information to the public web and
can define which of your “friends” on the same service are allowed
access to your information. However, these settings can sometimes be
confusing and difficult to configure correctly, and it’s unclear how
robust such privacy protections would be against the attacks of a
dedicated hacker. There’s also the possibility that an adversary may try
to “friend” you using fake information to pose as someone you know or
would want to know. (A good rule of thumb is to only become “friends”
with people that you know personally, after verifying with them via
another means of communication — for example, by emailing them or
calling them — to ensure that they are the ones that actually made the
request.). Then there’s the additional threat of adversaries gaining
access to your account information by convincing you to use their “app.”
Finally, of course, there’s always the risk that one of your “friends”
will republish to others the information that you thought you had posted
privately. So, even if you think you’ve strictly controlled access to
your Facebook profile or Flickr page, you should recognize the
significant risk that what you post there might leak out, and act
accordingly. Another option, if you’re more interested in sharing
information and opinion than in socializing, is to communicate
*anonymously*, without tying your posts to your real identity. For an
extended discussion of how to do that safely and effectively, take a
look at our guide on "`How to Blog Safely (About Work or Anything
Else)`_."
