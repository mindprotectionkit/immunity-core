<h3>Avoid SMS Text Messages If You Can<a class="headerlink" href="#avoid-sms-text-messages-if-you-can" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Text messaging over your cell phone using SMS can be an incredibly quick
and convenient way of communicating short messages, but from a privacy
perspective, it poses some serious problems.</p>
<p>First, just like your cell
phone conversations, SMS text messages sent to and from your cell phone
can easily be intercepted over radio with minimal equipment and without
any cooperation from the cell phone provider.</p>
<p>Second, just like with
your cell phone conversations, it’s unclear whether the Fourth Amendment
protects the radio signals that carry your SMS messages against
interception. This uncertainty increases the possibility that the
government may intercept such communications without a probable cause
warrant.</p>
<p>Third, and unlike your cell phone calls, SMS messages are
“electronic communications” rather than “wire communications,” and
therefore aren’t protected by the Wiretap Act’s exclusionary rule. That
means the statute would allow the government to use your messages
against you in a criminal case, even if they were intercepted without a
wiretap order in violation of the statute.</p>
<p>Finally, although the Wiretap
Act clearly does require the government to obtain a wiretap order before
intercepting SMS messages, just as with any other “electronic
communication,” we have heard anecdotal reports of the government
intercepting SMS messages without wiretap orders, instead using the
much-easier-to-obtain pen/trap orders. These reports are bolstered by
known cases where the government has obtained the content of stored SMS
messages under the lesser standards reserved for non-content
communications records.</p>
<p>Putting all these factors together, we currently
consider SMS messages to be highly vulnerable to government wiretapping,
and recommend reserving that mode of communication for only the most
trivial of communications, if you use it at all. The only exception is
if you use encryption to protect your SMS messages. For now, SMS
encryption software for cell phones is still quite rare, though you can
find information about such software for Java-enabled phones <a class="reference external" href="http://mobileactive.org/wiki/Mobile_Surveillance-A_Primer#SMS_Encryption_applications_for_Java-enabled_phones">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Old Ways are Often the Best Ways<a class="headerlink" href="#old-ways-are-often-the-best-ways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Considering the government’s broad capability to wiretap communications,
there isn’t much difference in the technical risk that wiretapping poses
to your phone calls versus your emails versus your SMS text messages.
However, as described in the last section, there are differences in the
legal protections for these modes of communication, and as will be
described later in this section, there may be technical steps that you
can take — such as <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/wire/protect/encrypt">encrypting</a> your communications — that may be
easier or harder depending on which communications method you choose.</p>
<p>So, when thinking about securing your communications against
eavesdropping and wiretapping, your first choice — whether to meet in
person, call on the telephone, write an email, or tap out an SMS text or
IM message — is also your most important choice. As you’ll see below,
the least technically sophisticated modes of communication like
face-to-face conversations and landline telephone conversations are
often the most secure against unwanted eavesdropping, unless you and
those you communicate with have mastered how to encrypt your Internet
communications.</p>

<h2>Defend Yourself Against Cell Phone Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#defend-yourself-against-cell-phone-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As described earlier, the government can use information transmitted by
your cellular telephone to track its location in real-time, whether
based on what cell phone towers your cell phone is communicating with,
or by using the GPS chip included in most cell phones.</p>
<p>Many courts have required the government to obtain a warrant before conducting this type
of surveillance, often thanks to briefing by EFF. (For more information
on our work in this area, visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/issues/cell-tracking">EFF’s cell tracking</a> page.) However,
many other courts have been happy to routinely authorize cell phone
tracking without probable cause.</p>
<p>Even more worrisome, the government has
the capability to track cell phones without the cell phone provider’s
assistance using a mobile tracking technology code-named
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/11/14/104215/56/181/660871">“triggerfish”</a>. This technology raises the possibility that the
government might bypass the courts altogether. Even if the government
does seek a court order before using “triggerfish,” though, it will only
need to get an easy-to-get pen-trap order rather than a wiretap order
based on probable cause.</p>
<p>Put simply, cell phone location tracking is an
incredibly powerful surveillance technology that is currently subject to
weak technical and legal protections.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you want to use
your cell phone at all, avoiding the threat of this kind of real-time
tracking is nearly impossible. That’s because the government can track
your cell phone whenever it’s on, even if you aren’t making a call. The
government can even track some cell phones when they are powered down,
unless you have also removed the battery. So, once again, there is a
security trade-off: the only way to eliminate the risk of location
tracking is to leave the cell phone at home, or remove the battery.</p>
<p>For more information about the privacy risks posed by cell phones, take a
look at our article on <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/mobile">mobile devices</a>. You may also want to take a

<h2>Face-to-Face Conversations<a class="headerlink" href="#face-to-face-conversations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="face-to-face-conversations-are-the-safest-bet">
<h3>Face-to-Face Conversations Are the Safest Bet<a class="headerlink" href="#face-to-face-conversations-are-the-safest-bet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As shown in the last section, government eavesdropping of your “oral
communications” or face-to-face conversations using “bugs” or hidden
microphones is very rare: only 20 court orders authorizing oral
intercepts were reported in the 2007 wiretap report, compared to 1,998
orders authorizing wiretapping of “wire communications” or voice
communications. In other words, you are 100 times more likely to have
your phone conversations tapped than to have your face-to-face
conversations “bugged”.</p>
<p>Not only are your oral conversations at less
risk than your phone conversations, but they also receive the same
strong legal protections as your phone conversations. Like your phone
calls and unlike your non-voice Internet communications, oral
communications that are intercepted in violation of the Wiretap Act are
subject to that statute’s exclusionary rule, and cannot be used against
you as evidence in a criminal trial.</p>
<p>Therefore, face-to-face
conversations in private are the most secure method of communicating.
Deciding whether to talk face-to-face rather than send an email or make
a telephone call becomes a traditional security trade-off: is the
inconvenience of having to meet face-to-face worth the security gain?
Depending on whom you want to talk to and where they are, that
inconvenience could be trivial or it could mean a cross-country trip. If
the person you want to communicate with is in the same office or just
next door, you may want to choose a private conversation even for
communications that aren’t particularly sensitive. When it comes to your
very most sensitive data, though, that cross-country flight might be
worth the trade-off.</p>
<p>Just because the risk of oral interception is very
low doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take technical precautions to reduce that
risk, particularly when it comes to very sensitive conversations.
Therefore, depending on how convenient it is and how sensitive the
conversation is — again, it’s a trade-off — you may want to have your
conversation in a room that does not contain a landline telephone or a
computer with a built-in or attached microphone or camera, and either
not carry your cell phone or remove its battery (the microphone on some
phones can be activated even when the phone is powered down, unless you
remove the battery). Even if your conversation isn’t especially
sensitive, it doesn’t hurt to detach external microphones and cameras
from your laptop or cover the lens of attached cameras with a small
piece of tape when they aren’t in use. It’s easy to do, and ensures that
remote activation of those mics and cameras is one less thing to worry
about.</p>

<h3>What About Phone Calls Using the Internet?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-phone-calls-using-the-internet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your “wire communications” or voice communications are subject to
stronger legal protections than your other communications, regardless of
what communications medium you use. So, for example, whether government
agents intercept your landline telephone call, your cellular telephone
call, or a telephone call made over the Internet, the Wiretap Act’s
exclusionary rule will prevent them from using that information as
evidence against you in a criminal trial if they didn’t get a wiretap
order first. In contrast, the statute wouldn’t prevent the government
from using illegally intercepted “electronic communications” like text
messages or emails as evidence.</p>
<p>Therefore, you may want to consider
using Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services, which allow you to send live voice
communications — basically, phone calls — over the Internet. VoIP may be
more private than regular calls for one big reason: it’s easier to
encrypt your conversation, as encrypting regular phone calls is very
difficult and expensive. Unfortunately, there isn’t any obviously
effective and trustworthy option for encrypted VoIP that we can
recommend at the moment. See our article on <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/voip">VoIP</a> for futher details.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-you-need-to-know">
<h3>What You Need to Know<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-need-to-know" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Due to a combination of legal and technical factors, face-to-face
conversations and conversations using landline telephones are more
secure against government wiretapping than cell phone or Internet
communications. Cell phone conversations are more vulnerable both
technically and legally, while SMS text messaging appears for now to be
very insecure both technically and legally. Cell phones also create the
risk of location tracking, and the only way to eliminate that risk
entirely is to not carry a cell phone or to remove the battery.</p>
<p>When it
comes to Internet communications, using encryption is the only way to
defend against wiretapping, whether by the government or anyone else.</p>
<p>When it comes to pen/trap taps, on the other hand, most encryption
products won’t protect the types of information that the government can
get. That information needs to be transmitted in the clear so computers
can direct it to the proper recipient. Only anonymizing tools like
<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/tor">Tor</a> will protect you from traffic analysis via pen/trap tap.</p>

<h3>Electronic Eavesdropping is Legally Hard for the Government, But Technically Easy<a class="headerlink" href="#electronic-eavesdropping-is-legally-hard-for-the-government-but-technically-easy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you learned in the last section, wiretapping is legally difficult for
the government: it must obtain a hard-to-get intercept order or
“super-warrant” from a court, subject to strict oversight and variety of
strong privacy protections. However, wiretapping is typically very
technically easy for the government. For example, practically anyone
within range of your laptop’s wireless signal, including the government,
can intercept your wireless Internet communications. Similarly,
practically anyone within range of your cell phone’s radio signal,
including the government, can — with a few hundred bucks to buy the
right equipment — eavesdrop on your cell phone conversations.</p>
<p>As far as
communications that travel over telecommunications’ companies cables and
wires rather than (or in addition to) traveling over the air, the
government has very sophisticated wiretapping capabilities. For example,
using a nationwide surveillance system called “DCSNet” (“DCS” stands for
“Digital Collection System”) that is tied into key telecommunications
switches across the country, FBI agents can from the comfort of their
field offices “go up” on a particular phone line and start intercepting
or pen-trap tapping wireline phone calls, cellular phone calls, SMS text
messages and push-to-talk communications, or start tracking a cell
phone’s location, at a moment’s notice. The government is believed to
have similar capabilities when it comes to Internet communications. The
extensive and powerful capabilities of the DCSNet, first uncovered in
government documents that EFF obtained in a Freedom of Information Act
lawsuit (details at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/issues/foia/061708CKK">http://www.eff.org/issues/foia/061708CKK</a>), are
well-summarized in the Wired.com article <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/08/wiretap">“Point, Click…Eavesdrop: How
the FBI Wiretap Net Operates”</a>.</p>
<p>Using “bugs” to eavesdrop on your oral conversations has also gotten
much easier for the government with changes in technology. Most notably,
the government now has the technical capability, with the cooperation of
your cell phone provider, to convert <a class="reference external" href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029-6140191.html">the microphone on some cell
phones</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/realityzone/UFNFBIspyincarcomputers.htm">the cell phone in your car’s emergency services system</a>
into a bug. The government likely also has the ability, with your phone
company’s help, to open the line on your landline phone and use its
microphone as a bug, although we’ve yet to see any specific cases where
such landline phone-based bugging has been used. Finally, the government
may even have the capability, using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/07/fbi_spyware">remotely-installed government
malware</a>, to turn on the microphone or camera on your computer.</p>

<h3>Learn to Encrypt Your Internet Communications<a class="headerlink" href="#learn-to-encrypt-your-internet-communications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Always remember that anyone with access to a wire or a computer carrying
your communications, or within range of your wireless signal, can
intercept your Internet communications with cheap and readily available
equipment and software. Lawyers call this wiretapping, while Internet
techies call it “packet sniffing” or “traffic sniffing”. The only way to
protect your Internet communications against wiretapping by the
government or anyone else is by using <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">`encryption`_</span></a>. Of course, it is
true that most encryption systems can be broken with enough effort.
However, breaking modern encryption systems usually requires that an
adversary find a mistake in the way that the encryption was engineered
or used. This often requires large amounts of effort and expense, and
means that encryption is usually a <em>critically</em> significant defensive
measure even when it isn’t totally impregnable.</p>
<p>Encryption,
unfortunately, isn’t always easy to use, so as in other cases, your
decision of whether to use it will pose a trade-off: is the
inconvenience of using the encryption worth the security benefit?</p>
<p>The
occasional inconvenience posed by some encryption systems is
counter-balanced by the fact that encryption will protect you against
much more than overzealous law enforcement agents. Your Internet
communications are vulnerable to a wide range of governmental and
private adversaries in addition to law enforcement, whether it’s the
National Security Agency or a hacker trying to intercept your credit
card number, and encryption will help you defend against those
adversaries as well.</p>
<p>Also, as described in later sections, encrypting
your communications not only protects against wiretapping but can also
protect your communications while they are stored with your
communications provider. So, for example, even if the government is able
to seize your emails from your provider, it won’t be able to read them.</p>
<p>Considering all the benefits of encryption, we think that it’s usually
worth the trade-off, although as always, your mileage may vary depending
on your tolerance for inconvience and on how serious you judge the
threat of wiretapping to be. In some cases, using encryption may not be
inconvenient at all. For example, the <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/im#im-encryption">OTR encryption system for IM</a> is
extremely easy to set up and use; there’s little reason not to give it a
try. Check out the following articles to learn more about how you can
use encryption to protect your internet communications against
wiretapping, as well as against traffic analysis using pen-trap taps.</p>
<p><strong>`Wi-Fi`_.</strong> Using encryption is especially critical when transmitting
your Internet communications over the air using Wi-Fi, since pretty much
anyone else in the area that has a wireless-enabled laptop can easily
intercept your radio signals. This article will explain how to encrypt
the radio signals sent between your laptop and a wireless access point.</p>
<p><strong>`Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)`_.</strong> Virtual Private Networks or
“VPNs” are a potent encryption tool allowing you to “tunnel”
communications securely over the Internet. <strong>`Web browsers`_.</strong> Some of
your web communications can be encrypted to protect against traffic
sniffing. Take a look at this article to learn more about HTTPS, the
most common web encryption standard, as well as other browser security
and privacy tips.</p>
<p><strong>`Email`_ and `IM`_.</strong> There are a number of powerful
tools available for encrypting your emails and your IM messages; take a

<div class="section" id="using-the-telephone">
<h2>Using the Telephone<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-telephone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If having an oral conversation is simply too great an inconvenience, the
second most secure option — unless you’ve mastered how to encrypt your
internet communications — is to use the phone. <em>Even though your phone
is statistically more likely to be wiretapped than your Internet
communications, the phone is still less risky than unencrypted Internet
communications.</em></p>
<p>This is true for several reasons. First and most
important, your phone calls don’t generate copies of your communications
— once your call is over, the communication disappears forever. Internet
communications, on the other hand and as discussed more below, generate
copies that make it easier and more likely that someone can find out
what you said. The risk of subpoenas to get these copies is much higher
than the risk of a phone wiretap. Also, many more potential adversaries
have or can gain access to your Internet traffic than to your phone
lines.</p>
<p>Also, remember that “wire communications” — that is, voice
communications — get more legal protection. If your voice communications
are wiretapped in violation of the Wiretap Act, they won’t be allowed as
evidence; illegally wiretapped Internet communications may still end up
in court. That means that investigators have less reason to avoid
stretching the law when it comes to your electronic communications.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, just as phone conversations are a safer bet than
unencrypted Internet communications, <em>telephone conversations between
landline telephones are a safer bet than telephone conversations that
involve a cellular telephone</em>. Most obviously, conversations that
involve cellular telephones are <em>technically</em> much easier to tap than
your landline phone conversations — anyone who is in range of a cell
phone’s radio signal can listen in using a few hundred dollars worth of
specialized cell phone interception equipment (for more discussion of
the security threats posed to mobile devices like cell phones, see the
article on <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/mobile">mobile devices</a>). If you are concerned that government
agents may ignore the law and choose to intercept your phone
conversations without a wiretap order, intercepting your cell phone’s
radio signals would be an effective way for them to secretly do so,
particularly considering that they do not need to get the assistance of
the cell phone provider and that their radio-based interception wouldn’t
leave any physical trace. Cell phone conversations may also be more
vulnerable <em>legally</em> — some courts have held that communications using
cordless telephones are not protected by the Fourth Amendment, finding
that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the radio signal
sent between the cordless handset and the base station. The government
may similarly consider the radio signal sent between your cell phone and
the cell phone company’s cell tower to be unprotected by the Fourth
Amendment.</p>
<div><p><strong>Privacy tip:</strong> Avoiding phone tap paranoiaContrary to popular belief,
modern phone wiretaps used by the government don’t make any noise — no
clicks, no hisses, no static, nothing. Don’t worry that the government
is monitoring you if you happen to hear some unexplained noise on the
phone line. You wouldn’t believe how often we’re told, “I think I’m
being wiretapped — I keep hearing clicks!”</p>
