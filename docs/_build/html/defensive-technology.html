<h2>Email<a class="headerlink" href="#email" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The act of using email stores data on your machines, transmits data over
the network, and stores data on third party machines.</p>
<div class="section" id="locally-stored-data">
<h3>Locally Stored Data<a class="headerlink" href="#locally-stored-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The usual measures apply to managing the copies of emails (both sent and
received) that are kept on your own machines. Encrypt your drives and
decide upon and follow an appropriate data deletion policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-on-the-wire">
<h3>Data on the Wire<a class="headerlink" href="#data-on-the-wire" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Email usually travels through a number of separate hops between the
sender and receiver. This diagram illustrates the typical steps messages
might travel through, the transmission protocols used for those steps,
and the available types of encryption for those steps. <a class="reference external" href="/img/email.png"><img alt="image_email_small" src="_images/email_small.jpg" /></a></p>
<div class="section" id="end-to-end-encryption-of-specific-emails">
<h4>End-to-End Encryption of Specific Emails<a class="headerlink" href="#end-to-end-encryption-of-specific-emails" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Encrypting emails all the way from the sender to the receiver has
historically been difficult, although the tools for achieving this kind
of end-to-end encryption are getting better and easier to use. Pretty
Good Privacy (PGP) and its free cousin GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) are the
standard tools for doing this. Both of these programs can provide
protection for your email in transit and also protect your stored data.
Major email clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird
can be configured to work smoothly with encryption software, making it a
simple matter of clicking a button to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt
email messages. The great thing about end-to-end encryption is that it
ensures that the contents of your emails will be protected not only
against interception on the wire, but also against some of the threats
to the contents of copies of your emails stored on your machine or third
party machines. There are two catches with GnuPG/PGP. The first is that
they only work if the other parties you are corresponding with also use
them. Inevitably, many of the people you exchange email with will not
use GPG/PGP, though it can be deployed amongst your friends or within an
organization.</p>
<p>The second catch is that you need to find and verify public keys for the
people you are sending email to, to ensure that eavesdroppers cannot
trick you into using the wrong key. This trickery is known as a “man in
the middle” attack. Probably the easiest way to start using GnuPG is to
use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php">Enigmail</a> plugin. You can find the
quick start guide for installing and configuring Enigmail <a class="reference external" href="http://www.enigmail.net/documentation/quickstart.php">Enigmal_Quickstart</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="server-to-server-encrypted-transit">
<h4>Server-to-Server Encrypted Transit<a class="headerlink" href="#server-to-server-encrypted-transit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After you press “send”, emails are typically relayed along a chain of
SMTP mail servers before reaching their destination. You can use your
mail client to look at the headers of any email you’ve received to see
the chain of servers the message traveled along. In most cases, messages
are passed between mail servers without encryption. But there is a
standard called SMTP over TLS which allows encryption when the sending
and receiving servers for a given hop of the chain support it. If you or
your organization operates a mail server, you should ensure that it
supports TLS encryption when talking to other mail servers. Consult the
documentation for your SMTP server software to find out how to enable
TLS.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="client-to-mail-server-encryption">
<h4>Client-to-Mail Server Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#client-to-mail-server-encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you use POP or IMAP to fetch your email, make sure it is encrypted
POP or IMAP. If your mail server doesn’t support the encrypted version
of that protocol, get your service provider or systems administrator to
fix that. If you use a webmail service, ensure that you only access it
using HTTPS rather than HTTP. Hushmail.com is a webmail service provider
that always uses HTTPS, and also offers some end-to-end encryption
facilities (though they are <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai.html">not immune to warrants</a>).</p>
<p>Many webmail service providers only use HTTPS for the login page, and
then revert to HTTP. This isn’t secure. Look for an account
configuration option (or a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.customizegoogle.com/">browser plugin</a>) to ensure that your
webmail account always uses HTTPS. In Gmail, for instance, you can find
this option in the “general” tab of the settings page: <img alt="image_gmail" src="_images/gmail_https.jpeg" /> If you
can’t find a way to ensure that you only see your webmail through https,
switch to a different web mail provider.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-stored-on-second-and-third-party-machines">
<h3>Data Stored on Second- and Third-Party Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#data-stored-on-second-and-third-party-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two main reasons why your emails will be stored on computers
controlled by third parties.</p>
<div class="section" id="storage-by-your-service-provider">
<h4>Storage by your Service Provider<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-by-your-service-provider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you don’t run your own mail server, then there is a third party who
obtains (and may store) copies of all of your emails. This would
commonly be an ISP, an employer, or a webmail provider. Copies of
messages will also be scattered across computers controlled by the ISPs,
employers and webmail hosts of those you correspond with. Make sure your
email software is configured so that it deletes messages off of your
ISP’s mail server after it downloads them. This is the most common
arrangement if you’re using POP to fetch your email, but it is common
for people to use IMAP or webmail to leave copies of messages on the
server. If you use webmail or IMAP, make sure you delete messages
immediately after you read them. Keep in mind that with major webmail
services, it may be a long time – maybe a matter of months – before the
message is really deleted, regardless of whether you still have access
to it or not. With smaller IMAP or webmail servers, it is possible that
forensically accessible copies of messages could be subpoenaed years
after the user deleted them.</p>
<p>The content of PGP/GnuPG encrypted emails will not be accessible through
these third parties, although the email headers (such as the To: and
Subject: lines) will be. Running your own mail server with an encrypted
drive, or using end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications, are
the best ways of mitigating these risks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-by-those-you-correspond-with">
<h4>Storage by Those You Correspond With<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-by-those-you-correspond-with" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people and organizations save all of the email they send and
receive. Therefore, almost every email you send and receive will be
stored in at least one other place, regardless of the practices and
procedures you follow. In addition to the personal machine of the person
you sent/received the message to/from, copies might be made on their ISP
or firm’s mail or backup servers. You should take these copies into
consideration, and if the threat model you have for sensitive
communications includes an adversary that might gain access to those
copies, then you should either use PGP to encrypt those messages, or
send them by some means other than email. Be aware that even if you use
PGP, those you communicate with could be subject to subpoenas or
requests from law enforcement to decrypt your correspondence.</p>

<h3>End-to-End Email Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#end-to-end-email-encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Email encryption is a topic that could fill a book, and has: see Bruce
Schneier’s book <em>Email Security: How to Keep Your Electronic Messages
Private</em>. While this book is somewhat out of date (it refers to old
versions of software), the concepts it introduces are essential.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Encryption Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Encryption is a technique that uses math to transform information in a
way that makes it unreadable to anyone except those with special
knowledge, usually referred to as a “key.” There are many applications
of encryption, but some of the most important uses help protect the
security and privacy of files on your computer, information passing over
the Internet, or left sitting in a file on someone else’s computer. If
encryption is used properly, the information should only be readable by
you and people that receive the key from you. Encryption provides a very
strong technical protection against many kinds of threats — and this
protection is often easy to obtain.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-does-encryption-work">
<h3>How Does Encryption Work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-encryption-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What do you need to know about how encryption works? Surprisingly
little. Encryption is conceptually similar to the “secret codes” that
children learn about and use to communicate. If you’ve ever spoken in
pig Latin or used a decoder ring, you’ve used very simple encryption
techniques on a message. Again, the idea is to take a normal
human-readable message (often called the plaintext message) and
transform it into an incomprehensible format that can only become
comprehensible again to someone with secret knowledge:</p>
<p>Plaintext message
+ Encryption algorithm + Key = Scrambled message</p>
<p>Decryption algorithm +
Key + Scrambled message = Plaintext Message</p>
<p><strong>Your Little Brother’s Cryptography.</strong> A simple encryption system would
be to change each letter in your message to a set number of letters
later in the alphabet. The specific number of spaces you move down the
alphabet for each letter is the secret key. If the key is two, A becomes
C, B becomes D, C becomes E, etc. Using that encryption system, the
plaintext message “INSECURE” would become “KPUGEWTG.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-is-encryption-applied">
<h3>How is Encryption Applied?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-is-encryption-applied" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although the mechanics of encryption can be explained by the “decoder
ring” analogy, the modern practice of using encryption has been
accurately described as using a very resilient envelope for your
messages. Most unencrypted data transmitted online is accessible to the
servers passing off the information. Conversely, using encryption puts
your online communications in a “steel envelope” — they can’t be read in
the course of delivering the message to the recipient and are extremely
resistant to tampering.</p>
<p>Modern encryption is very difficult to break,
using very complex mathematics to scramble information and ensure that
only people possessing the right key can unscramble it. In many cases
you can get major security benefits from encryption without a detailed
understanding of how it works. Some software implements very convenient,
fully automated encryption features which may simply require that you
turn them on.</p>
<p>For instance, when a website is configured properly, web
browsers can use SSL encryption to protect the privacy of information
you send to or receive from a web server. This is most often used to
protect log-in passwords and financial data. Using a browser’s SSL
encryption can be as simple as accessing a site with the https scheme
instead of the http scheme (for instance, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eff.org/">https://www.eff.org/</a>instead
of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/">http://www.eff.org/</a>); the browser typically takes care of all the
details behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-encryption-important">
<h3>Why Is Encryption Important?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-encryption-important" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Encryption plays an important role in mitigating risk related to the
many threats listed in this guide. If sensitive information stored on
your computer is encrypted, it will take a secret key to decode it. If
sensitive information en route to others is encrypted, only someone that
knows the secret key can read what it says. When you encrypt sensitive
information and it ends up logged by others in the course of
communicating online, encryption keeps those without the secret key from
knowing the contents of the message.</p>
<p>Most of the Defensive Technology articles in this guide will cover
practical ways to apply encryption to particular communications (like
email) or particular applications (like web browsers).</p>
<p>Encryption is
absolutely essential to maintaining information security. Moreover,
modern computers are powerful enough that we can aim to make encryption
of our communications and data routine, not just reserving encryption
for special occasions or particularly sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="for-more-about-encryption">
<h3>For More About Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#for-more-about-encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many encryption tools can be used successfully without much beyond a
conceptual understanding. We explain how to use many of these
well-developed tools in other parts of this guide.</p>
<p>However, be aware
that while encryption is a powerful tool and is critical to information
security, it has limitations — particularly if it is not being used
correctly. Learning more about encryption and its limitations can help
ensure that you’re using it properly and getting protection against as
many kinds of attacks as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2>File and Disk Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modern operating systems allow you to use a system of accounts and
passwords to limit access to data on a computer. This may be useful when
adversaries have casual passing access to your machine, but those
accounts and passwords will not protect your data if your computer is
stolen or seized — or if the adversaries have more than a minute or two
alone with your computer. There are many ways (such as plugging your
hard disk into another computer, or booting another operating system
using a CD or USB key) that would allow files to be read off the disk.
<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/deletion">Even deleted files may be recoverable</a>.</p>
<p>The theft or seizure threats
can be mitigated by encrypting the data on the disk. Some sort of
mitigation is especially important for laptops, which are at high risk
of being lost or stolen, but the same measures can be useful for
improving the security of any client or workstation-type computer.</p>
<p><strong>Full-disk encryption</strong> is meant to protect stored data against this
sort of exposure, if the computer is stolen or seized when it is powered
off. If the computer is seized while running, there are <a class="reference external" href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/">tricks</a> that
sophisticated adversaries could use to read the data regardless of
encryption.</p>
<p><strong>File encryption</strong> is disk encryption that only applies to
certain specific files on your computer. It may be easier to deploy but
is vulnerable to several threats that do not apply to full disk
encryption.</p>
<p><strong>Hard disk passwords</strong> are a feature offered by many laptop
manufacturers. These can be enabled within the <a class="reference external" href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios.htm">BIOS</a> of your computer.
Hard disk passwords <em>don’t encrypt any data on your drive</em>, they just
prevent the drive from cooperating with the computer until the password
is supplied. There are numerous commercial services which will disable
these passwords for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pwcrack.com/harddisk.shtml">about $100 per drive</a>. So a hard disk password is
useful against a casual thief, but of no use against law enforcement or
other non-casual adversaries.</p>
<div class="section" id="should-i-encrypt-my-drive">
<h3>Should I Encrypt My Drive?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-i-encrypt-my-drive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Everybody should use either disk encryption or a hard disk password
(possibly augmented with file encryption) on their laptops. If your
laptop has personal data but you would not regard any of it as
sensitive, a hard disk password may be quick and easy, and sufficient
protection in case of theft.</p>
<p>If your computer contains a very small and
easily quantified set of somewhat sensitive documents, it may be
sufficient to use file encryption for those documents, alongside a hard
disk password.</p>
<p>If you computer contains a larger (or harder to quantify)
set of sensitive documents, or any documents which might be considered
<em>highly</em> sensitive, it is best to use full disk encryption. In such
cases the threat posed by <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/malware">Malware_Tech</a> should also be taken into account.</p>
<div class="section" id="disk-encryption-is-of-little-use-in-civil-lawsuits">
<h4>Disk Encryption Is Of Little Use in Civil Lawsuits<a class="headerlink" href="#disk-encryption-is-of-little-use-in-civil-lawsuits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is extremely important to note that disk encryption is unlikely to
offer much protection against civil litigation. Many of the procedural
obstacles which might apply to law enforcement attempts to obtain
encrypted data during a criminal investigation would not apply in a
civil case. If an adversary in a civil case persuades a judge to issue a
subpoena for your data, a failure to decrypt and disclose the data would
be held against you in the case.</p>
<p>If your threat model involves civil litigation, it is essential to
simply not have the data on a computer in the first place, or to have
<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/deletion">Secure Deletion</a> practices in place long before any lawsuit is filed.
Once a lawsuit is filed, you will be obliged to preserve any pertinent
documents, and the presence of forensic evidence that you deleted data
after a suit was filed would have dire consequences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-disk-encryption-software">
<h3>Choosing Disk Encryption Software<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-disk-encryption-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are many full-disk encryption tools. Using a mainstream one is
probably safer than an obscure one, since mainstream disk encryption
products have usually received more expert review. Leading disk
encryption programs include <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitlocker.com/">BitLocker</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgpdisk/">PGPDisk</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1877.html">FileVault</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/">dm-crypt (LUKS)</a>; some of these come with the
operating system, while others are third-party add-ons. You can read a
detailed comparison of these and many other disk encryption products
from <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_disk_encryption_software">a comparison at Wikipedia</a>. This comparison may help you select a
disk encryption product to meet your needs, but any of these systems can
protect your data better than having no disk encryption at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="things-to-know-when-using-disk-encryption">
<h3>Things To Know When Using Disk Encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-when-using-disk-encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally, disk encryption software will require you to enter a separate
disk password when you turn the computer on or start using the disk
(some systems can use a smartcard instead of or in addition to a
password). To be effective, this password must be <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/your-computer/protect/passwords">resistant to all
forms of automated guessing</a>. Remember that the disk encryption is
fully effective at preventing access to the disk when the computer is
turned off (or the encrypted disk is entirely <em>unmounted</em> or removed
from use); to get the full benefit, you should unmount the encrypted
disk or turn the computer off in any situation where the risk of
compromise is especially high, such as a computer left unattended
overnight or a laptop being carried from place to place. (Using disk
encryption without following this precaution scrupulously will still
provide more protection against some attackers than not using disk
encryption.)</p>
<p>Finally, full-disk encryption can also be used on servers, providing
some protection against seizure of the servers. However, even servers
with encrypted hard drives could be vulnerable to attackers with
specialized techniques if they’re seized while they’re operating. Proper
use of disk encryption on servers can also be a nuisance because the
server can’t do a fully unattended automatic reboot. (It’s not safe to
store the password for the disk on the server itself, so an
administrator will have to enter the disk password whenever the computer
is restarted.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plausible-deniability">
<h3>Plausible Deniability<a class="headerlink" href="#plausible-deniability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One interesting property which some disk encryption developers are
working towards is <strong>plausible deniability</strong>. The goal of these efforts
is to offer users a way to not only encrypt their files, but to prevent
an attacker from being able to even deduce the existence of some of the
encrypted files. The user will have a way to “plausibly deny” that the
files exist.</p>
<p>One example of this concept is TrueCrypt’s ability to have
an encrypted partition (which can be hidden as any file on your hard
drive) and within that partition hide another partition. One password
will reveal the outer partition and another separate password will
reveal the inner one. Because of the way TrueCrypt encrypts the
partition table itself, an observer cannot detect a hidden partition
even if she has access to the “regular” encrypted share. The idea is to
give the user something to decrypt if a law enforcement officer or
Customs official asks, while keeping the rest of their information
secure.</p>
<p>In practice, TrueCrypt’s first attempt to implement this feature
was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/07/truecrypts_deni.html">shown to be ineffective</a> because operating systems and
applications leave so many traces of the files they work with, that a
forensic investigator would have many avenues by which to determine that
the inner partition existed. The TrueCrypt developers have responded to
this research by offering a way to install and boot from an entire
separate operating system within the inner partition. It is too soon to
know whether their new approach will turn out to offer secure plausible
deniability.</p>
<p>Technical issues aside, remember that lying to a federal
law enforcement officer about material facts is a crime, so if a person
chose to answer a question about whether there were additional encrypted
partitions on a computer, they would be legally obligated to answer
truthfully.</p>

<h3>Instant messaging is a convenient way to communicate with people online. In privacy terms, it’s a bit better and easier to secure than email but in some situations a telephone call will offer you better privacy.<a class="headerlink" href="#instant-messaging-is-a-convenient-way-to-communicate-with-people-online-in-privacy-terms-its-a-bit-better-and-easier-to-secure-than-email-but-in-some-situations-a-telephone-call-will-offer-you-better-privacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Instant messaging software creates data stored on your computer (logs of
your communications), transmits communications over the network (the
messages traveling back and forth), and leaves communications stored on
other computers (logs kept by the people you talk to, and sometimes logs
kept by the IM provider). If you use IM without taking special
precautions, you can assume that all of these records will be available
to adversaries. The easiest way for an adversary to obtain the contents
of your communications is from you, your correspondent, or your service
provider, if any of those parties logs (stores) the messages. The more
difficult way is to intercept the messages as they travel over the
network.</p>

<h3>Encrypt Your Instant Messaging Conversations as They Travel<a class="headerlink" href="#encrypt-your-instant-messaging-conversations-as-they-travel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To protect messages from interception as they travel over the network,
you need to use encryption. Fortunately, there is an excellent instant
messaging encryption system called OTR (Off The Record).<em>Confusingly,
Google has a **different*</em> instant messaging privacy feature which is
also called “Off The Record”.* To disambiguate them, this page will talk
bout “OTR encryption” and “Google OTR”. It’s actually possible to be
using them both at the same time. If you and the person you are talking
to both use OTR encryption, you have excellent protection for
communications on the network, and you will prevent your IM provider
from storing the <em>content</em> of your communications (though they may still
keep records of who you talk to). The easiest way to use OTR encryption
is to use <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.adium.im/">Adium</a> for your IMs (Pidgin is a program that
will talk to your friends over the MSN, Yahoo!, Google, Jabber, and AIM
networks; Adium is a similar program specifically for Mac OS X). If
you’re using Pidgin, install the the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/#downloads">OTR encryption plugin for that
client</a>. Adium comes with OTR built in.</p>
<p>With OTR encryption installed, you still need to do a few things for
network privacy:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Read and understand OTR encryptions’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/help/buttonhelp.php?lang=en%20status">information</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure the people you are talking to also use OTR encryption, and
make sure it’s active. (In Pidgin, check for OTR:private or
OTR:unverfied in the bottom right corner.)</li>
<li>Follow OTR encryption’s instructions to “Confirm” any person you need
to have sensitive conversations with. This reduces the risk of an
interloper (including the government with a warrant) being able to
trick you into talking to them instead of the person you meant to
talk to. Recent versions of OTR encryption allow you to do this just
by agreeing on a shared secret word that you both have to type (“what
was the name of the friend who introduced us?”). Older versions
required that both users check that their client reported the right
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_fingerprint">fingerprint</a> for the other client.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configure Your IM Client to use SSL/TLS<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-your-im-client-to-use-ssl-tls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This step is complementary to using OTR encryption. It will prevent
someone watching the network from seeing who you are chatting to, and
will offer partial protection of your chats even if the other party
isn’t using OTR. If you are using Pidgin, you can ensure SSL is enabled

<h3>Understand and Control IM Logging on Your Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#understand-and-control-im-logging-on-your-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To protect the privacy of your IM conversations, you will need to decide
what to do about logs kept on your computer. You have three choices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure your IM client to not keep logs</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/disk-encryption">Encrypt your hard disk</a></li>
<li>Accept the risk that anyone who has access to your computer can read

</ul>
<p>If at some point you decide to configure your IM client not to keep

<h3>Be Aware of Logging on Others’ Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#be-aware-of-logging-on-others-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As noted above, using OTR encryption will ensure that your IM service
provider should be unable to log the contents of your communications.
They will, however, be in a position to record who you talk to, and
possibly record the timing and length of the messages you exchange.</p>
<p>OTR encryption does not stop the people you are talking to from logging
your conversations. Unless you trust that they have disabled logging in
their client or that they encrypt their hard disk and will not turn over
its contents, you should assume that an adversary could obtain records
of your conversations from the other party, either voluntarily or
through subpoena or search.</p>
<div class="section" id="google-otr">
<h4>Google OTR<a class="headerlink" href="#google-otr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Google OTR is a feature of the Google instant messaging service that
allows you to request that neither Google nor the people your talk to
should be able to log your conversations. Unfortunately, there is no
plausible enforcement mechanism for this feature. The people you talk to
could be using a different IM client (like Pidgin or Adium) that can log
regardless of whether Google OTR is enabled — or they could take
screenshots of your conversations. Your client might be able to tell you
whether they are using a client that follows the OTR rules (such as
Gmail or Gchat), but that won’t tell you whether they are taking
screenshots. The bottom line is that Google OTR is nice in theory but
insecure in practice. Turn it on, but don’t expect it to work if the
other party uses a non-Google client or actively wants to record the
converstion.</p>

<h2>Internet Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Internet is a global network of many individual computer networks,
all speaking the same computer language, the Internet Protocol (IP).
Every computer connected to the Internet has an IP address, a unique
numeric identifier that can be “static”, i.e. unchanging, or may be
“dynamically” assigned by your ISP, such that your computer’s address
changes with each new Internet session.</p>
<p>More sophisticated networking
protocols may be “layered” on top of the IP protocol, enabling different
types of Internet communications. For instance, World Wide Web (Web)
communications are transmitted via the HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) and e-mails via the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP).</p>
<p>These
additional protocols use their own types of addresses, apart from IP
addresses. For example, to download a Web page, you need its Web
address, known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) (e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/">http://www.eff.org</a>). To exchange e-mails, both the sender and
recipient need e-mail addresses (e.g., <a class="reference external" href="mailto:user&#37;&#52;&#48;emailprovider&#46;com">user<span>&#64;</span>emailprovider<span>&#46;</span>com</a>).</p>
<p>Computers that offer files for download over the Internet are called
servers or hosts. For example, a computer that offers Web pages for
download is called an HTTP server or Web host. Any computer may be
server, client, or both, depending on the communication. The amount of
data in an Internet communication is measured in bytes.</p>
<p>Communications
to and from an Internet-connected computer occur through 65,536
different computer software “ports.” Many networking protocols have been
assigned to particular port numbers by the Internet Engineering Task
Force. For example, HTTP (Web) is assigned to port 80 and SMTP (e-mail)
is assigned to port 25. However, any port can be used for any
application, and these are only conventions.</p>

malware. Note that some programs may belong to more than one of those
categories.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-does-malware-get-onto-a-computer">
<h3>How Does Malware Get Onto a Computer?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-malware-get-onto-a-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some malware is spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating
systems or application software. These vulnerabilities are design or
programming errors in software that can allow a clever programmer to
trick the defective software into giving someone else control.
Unfortunately, such vulnerabilities have been found in a wide variety of
mainstream software, and more are detected all the time — both by those
trying to fix the vulnerabilities and by those trying to exploit them.</p>
<p>Another common vector by which malware spreads is to trick the computer
user into running a software program that does something the user
wouldn’t have wanted. Tricking the user is a pretty powerful way to take
over a computer, because the attacker doesn’t have to depend on finding
a serious weakness in mainstream software. It is especially difficult to
be sure that computers shared by several users, or a computer in a
public place such as a library or Internet café, are not compromised. If
a single user is tricked into running a malware installer, every
subsequent user, no matter how cautious, could be at risk. Malware
written by sophisticated programmers generally leaves no immediately
visible signs of its presence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-malware-capable-of">
<h3>What is Malware Capable of?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-malware-capable-of" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Malware is extremely bad news from a security and privacy perspective.
Malware may be capable of stealing account details and passwords,
reading the documents on a computer (including encrypted documents, if
the user has typed in the password), defeating attempts to access the
Internet anonymously, taking screenshots of your desktop, and hiding
itself from other programs. Malware is even capable of using your
computer’s microphone, webcam, or other peripherals against you.</p>
<p>The
chief limitation in malware’s capability is that the author needs to (1)
have anticipated the need for the malware to do something, (2) spent a
substantial amount of effort programming the malicious feature, testing
that it works and is robust on numerous different versions of an
operating system, and (3) be free of legal or other restrictions
preventing the implementation of the feature.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/malware_biz.pdf">black market</a> has appeared in recent years that
<em>sells</em> malware customized for various purposes. This has reduced the
obstacles listed in category (2) above.</p>
<p>The most alarming feature of
malware is that, once installed, it can potentially nullify the benefits
of other security precautions. For example, malware can be used to
bypass the protections of encryption software even if this software is
otherwise used properly. On the other hand, the majority of malware is
mainly designed to do other things, like popping up advertisements or
hijacking a computer to send spam.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-malware-infection-likely">
<h3>Is Malware Infection Likely?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-malware-infection-likely" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Nobody knows how many computers are infected with malware, but informed
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/malware_biz.pdf">estimates</a> range from 40% to almost 90% of computers running Windows
operating systems. Infection rates are lower for MacOS and Linux
systems, but this is not necessarily because Windows is an easier
target. Indeed, recent versions of Windows are much improved in
security. Rather, more malware authors target Windows machines because
an effective attack will give them control of more computers.</p>
<p>The risk
that any given computer is infected with malware is therefore quite high
unless skilled computer security specialists are putting a substantial
amount of effort into securing the system. With time, any machine on
which security updates are not installed promptly is virtually
guaranteed to become infected. It is however overwhelmingly likely that
the malware in question will be working on obtaining credit card
numbers, obtaining eBay account passwords, obtaining online banking
passwords, sending spam, or launching denial of service attacks, rather
than spying on specific individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>Infection by
malware run by U.S. law enforcement or other governmental agencies is
also possible, though vastly less likely. There have been a handful of
cases in which it is known that <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/your-computer/govt/warrants">warrants</a> were obtained to install
malware to identify a suspect or record their communications (see the
section on <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/book/export/html/14#cipav">CIPAV</a> below). It is unlikely that U.S. government agencies
would use malware except as part of significant and expensive
investigations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-can-you-reduce-the-risk-of-malware-infection">
<h3>How Can You Reduce the Risk of Malware Infection?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-you-reduce-the-risk-of-malware-infection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently, running a minority operating system significantly diminishes
the risk of infection because fewer malware applications have been
targeted at these platforms. (The overwhelming majority of existing
malware targets only a single particular operating system.)</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities due to software defects are difficult to mitigate.
Installing software updates promptly and regularly can ensure that at
least known defects are repaired.</p>
<p>Not installing (or running) <em>any</em> software of unknown provenance is an
important precaution to avoid being tricked into installing malware.
This includes, for example, software applications advertised by banner
ads or pop-ups, or distributed by e-mail (even if disguised as something
other than a computer program). Recent operating systems attempt to warn
users about running software from an unknown source; these security
warnings serve an important purpose and should not be casually ignored.
Strictly limiting the number of users of a computer containing sensitive
information can also be helpful. Notably, some malware targets children,
including malicious code along with downloadable video games. (Of
course, computer users of any age can be tricked into installing
malware!)</p>
<p>On Windows, regularly running antivirus and antispyware
software can remove a large proportion of common malware. However, this
software is not effective against all malware, and must be regularly
updated. Since anti-malware software is created by researching malware
discovered “in the wild,” it’s also probably ineffective against
uncommon, specially-targeted malware applications that aim to infect
only a few specific computers rather than a large population on the
Internet.</p>

<div class="section" id="problems-with-cellular-device-privacy">
<h3>Problems with Cellular Device Privacy<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-with-cellular-device-privacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cell phones pose several privacy problems.</p>
<p><strong>No Anonymity.</strong> Every cell
phone has several unique identifying numbers. For a GSM phone these
include the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMEI">IMEI number</a> for the handset itself and the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI">IMSI</a> in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscriber_Identity_Module">SIM card</a>. Unless you have purchased your handset and account
anonymously, these will be linked to your real identity. Even if you
have an anonymous handset and account, the typical use pattern of a
phone is almost always enough to link it to your identity.</p>
<p><strong>Location
tracking.</strong> Cell phones communicate with transmission towers. The
strength of the signal received by these towers from a phone is a
measure of distance, and this allows the phone network to<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_localization">know where
its users are</a>. Many if not all networks log <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_of_origin_%28telecommunications%29">approximate location</a> on
a regular basis. These records may be subject to <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/3rdparties/govt/subpoena">subpoena.</a> If your
adversary is law enforcement and has probable cause for a <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/3rdparties/govt/court-order">warrant</a>,
they could receive continuous <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation">triangulation</a> location surveillance
data from the network.</p>
<p><strong>Easy interception.</strong> Cell phone communications
are sent through the air like communications from a walkie-talkie, and
encryption is usually inadequate or absent. Although there are
substantial legal protections for the privacy of cell phone calls, it’s
technologically straightforward to intercept cell phone calls on many
cell networks without the cooperation of the carrier, and the technology
to do this is only getting cheaper. Such interception without legal
process could be a serious violation of privacy laws, but would be
immensely difficult to detect. U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies
have the technical capacity to intercept unencrypted and weakly
encrypted cell phone calls on a routine basis.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of user control.</strong> Cell phones tend to run proprietary operating
systems, and the operating systems on different devices tend to be
different from each other. This means for instance that on most cell
phones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it’s impossible to guarantee that the phone is using secure
encryption for its transmissions, or determine whether it’s using
encryption at all</li>
<li>it’s very difficult for the user to gain access to and control over
the data recorded by the phone’s operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>However, because cell phones do not create stored records of the
contents of your communications, telephonic communication has certain
privacy advantages over other modes of communication, like<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/email">Email</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/im">instant messaging</a> or text messaging which do create such records.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-stored-by-your-phone">
<h3>Data Stored by Your Phone<a class="headerlink" href="#data-stored-by-your-phone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your phone will store the contents of the text messages you send and
receive, the times and numbers of the calls you make and receive, and
possibly other information such as location-related data.<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/deletion">Secure
Deletion</a> of this data poses a challenge. On most mobile devices your
best strategy is to manually delete these records using the phone’s user
interface, and then hope that new records will overwrite them. If you
have deleted all your text messages and calls, and waited long enough
for the phone’s memory to fill, there is a chance that later forensic
investigation would not find the original data.</p>
<p>There are a couple of
<a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/disk-encryption">drive encryption</a> programs available for devices that run the Windows
Mobile operating system. Proprietary drive encryption that has not been
audited by the computer security community should always be treated with
caution; it is probably better than no protection at all, although even
that is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>We are hopeful that the arrival of open
Linux-based phones (notably OpenMoko and those using the Google Android
code) will offer users better control over stored data in the future.</p>
<p>The undeleted data could be accessible to anyone who takes physical
possession of the phone, including thieves or an arresting officer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transmitted-data">
<h3>Transmitted Data<a class="headerlink" href="#transmitted-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>control data</strong> and actual voice conversations sent by cellular
devices may be encrypted using various standard encryption protocols.
There is no guarantee that this will occur — phones do not usually offer
users a way to refuse to operate in unencrypted mode, and many don’t
indicate whether they are using encryption. As a result, it is largely
up to the network operator to decide if its users will receive any
cryptographic defense against eavesdropping.</p>
<p>Carrier-provided encryption
can be good protection against eavesdropping by third parties. However,
if it is the carrier that wants to listen in, or the government with a
warrant ordering the carrier to allow wiretapping access to your calls,
then that encryption will not protect you because the carrier has the
means to decrypt.</p>
<p>Even if your cell phone is communicating in an
encrypted fashion, it turns out that most of the standard cryptography
used in cell networks has been broken. This means that an adversary that
is motivated and able to intercept radio communications and cryptanalyze
them will be able to listen to your phone calls.</p>
<p>It would be
technologically possible to use strong end-to-end encryption with voice
calls, but this technology is not yet widely available. The German
company GMSK has begun selling a GSM-based “Cryptophone”; as with
computer encryption, both users would need to be using the technology in
order to make it work. Some third parties have produced software to
encrypt SMS text messages; here, again, both the sender and recipient of
a message would need to use compatible software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-stored-by-other-parties">
<h3>Data Stored by Other Parties<a class="headerlink" href="#data-stored-by-other-parties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A great deal of data pertaining to your use of your phone will be stored
by the telephone company or companies that are providing you with
service. A more diffuse set of records will also be stored by the phones
of the people you communicate with.</p>
<p>Expect your telephone company to keep a record of: who you talk to and
when; who you exchange messages with and when; what data you send and
receive using wireless data services; information revealing your
physical location at any time when your phone is on; and whether your
phone is on or off.</p>
<p>The text messages exchanged by your phone — as well
as summary information for the calls you sent and receive from other
cell phones — are likely to be stored by those other cell phones. As
anyone who follows celebrity gossip should know, the people you are
communicating with can disclose the contents of your communications.
Other adversaries may use subpoenas or other legal process to obtain
text messages or call information.</p>

<h3>Malware for Phones<a class="headerlink" href="#malware-for-phones" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

a warrant, assume that your phone could be reprogrammed with malware to

<p>Under these extreme circumstances, it is possible for your phone
to be turned into a remote bugging device. It is possible for a phone to
remain on even when you press the “off” button, but not if you remove
the battery.</p>

<h2>Secure Deletion<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Secure deletion</strong> involves the use of special software to ensure that
when you delete a file, there really is no way to get it back again.
When you “delete” a file — for instance, by putting the file in your
computer’s trash folder and emptying the trash — you may think you’ve
deleted that file. But you really haven’t. Instead, the computer has
just made the file invisible to the user, and marked the part of the
disk drive that it is stored on as “empty,” meaning that it can be
overwritten with new data. But it may be weeks, months, or even years
before that data is overwritten, and the computer forensics experts can
often even retrieve data that has been overwritten by newer files.
Indeed, computers normally don’t “delete” data; they just allow it to be
overwritten over time, and overwritten again.</p>
<p>The best way to keep those
“deleted” files hidden, then, is to make sure they get overwritten
immediately. Your operating system probably already includes software
that can do this for you, and overwrite all of the “empty” space on your
disk with gibberish (optionally multiple times), and thereby protect the
confidentiality of deleted data. Examples include GNU Shred (Linux),
Secure Delete (Mac OS X), and cipher.exe (Windows XP Pro and later).</p>

<h4>Secure Deletion of Individual Files<a class="headerlink" href="#id11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Linux, FreeBSD and many other UNIX systems have a command line tool
called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shred</span></tt> installed on them. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Shred</span></tt> works quite differently to
the Windows cipher.exe program; rather than trying to prevent previously
deleted files from being recoverable, it singles out specified files and
repeatedly overwrites them and their names with random data. If you are
comfortable using a terminal or command line, secure deletion of files
with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shred</span></tt> is simple. Just run the following command: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shred</span> <span class="pre">-u</span></tt></p>

<h4>Ensuring Previously Deleted Data Cannot be Recovered<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Unfortunately we are not aware of any standard Linux/UNIX tools for
overwriting previously deleted files to prevent undeletion. A hack
solution that may work is to write zeroes or random data to a file on
the drive until it fills up all of the available space, then delete it.
Unfortunately, this will fill up the filesystem and may therefore make
the system unstable while it is in progress. Caveat emptor. On Linux
systems, you could try to achieve this by running the following command
as root:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dd</span> <span class="pre">if=/dev/zero</span> <span class="pre">of=/directory/junkfile</span> <span class="pre">;</span> <span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">/directory/junkfile</span></tt>
Replace <strong>/directory/</strong> with a directory that is within the mounted
partition within which you wish to ensure that forensic undeletion is
impossible. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dd</span></tt> command will take a long time to run and will
finish with an error saying the disk is full; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span></tt> will then
delete the huge file full of random junk.</p>
<p>Replacing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/zero</span></tt> with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/dev/urandom</span></tt> uses random data instead
of zeroes; that will result in slightly more secure erasure, but can
take much longer.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-warning-about-the-limitations-of-secure-deletion-tools">
<h3>A Warning About the Limitations of Secure Deletion Tools<a class="headerlink" href="#a-warning-about-the-limitations-of-secure-deletion-tools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even if you follow the advice above, there is a chance that certain
traces of deleted files may persist on your computer, not because the
files themselves haven’t been properly deleted, but because some part of
the operating system or some other program keeps a deliberate record of
them.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which this could occur, but two examples
should suffice to convey the possibility. On Windows, a copy of
Microsoft Office may retain a reference to the name of a file in the
“Recent Documents” menu, even if the file has been deleted (office might
sometimes even keep temporary files containing the <em>contents</em> of the
file). On a Linux or other *nix system, a user’s shell history file may
contain commands that include the file’s name, even though the file has
been securely deleted. And OpenOffice may keep as many records as
Microsoft Office. In practice, there may be dozens of programs that
behave like this.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know how to respond to this problem. It
is safe to assume that even if a file has been securely deleted, its
name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer.
Overwriting the entire disk is the only way to be 100% sure the name is
gone. Some of you may be wondering, “Could I search the raw data on the
disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?” The answer is
yes and no. Searching the disk (eg by using a command like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">-ab</span> <span class="pre">/dev/</span></tt> on Linux) will tell you if the data is present in
plaintext, but it won’t tell you if some program has compressed or
otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself
does not leave a record! The probability that the file’s contents may
persist is lower, but not impossible. Overwriting the entire disk and
installing fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain
that records of a file have been erased.</p>

<h3>Secure Deletion When Discarding Old Hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-deletion-when-discarding-old-hardware" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to finally throw a piece of hardware away or sell it on
eBay, you’ll want to make sure no one can retrieve your data from it.
(Studies have repeatedly found that computer owners usually fail to do
this — and hard drives are resold chock-full of highly sensitive
information.) So, before selling or recycling a computer, be sure to
overwrite its storage media with gibberish first. (Even if you’re not
getting rid of it right away, if you have a computer that’s reached the
end of its useful life and is no longer in use, it’s also safer to wipe
the hard drive before stashing the machine in a corner or a
closet.)<a class="reference external" href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/">Darik’s Boot and Nuke</a> is an excellent free tool for this
purpose.</p>
<p>Some full-disk encryption software has the ability to destroy the master
key, rendering a hard drive’s encrypted contents permanently
incomprehensible. Since the key is a tiny amount of data and can be
destroyed almost instantaneously, this represents a much faster
alternative to overwriting with software like Darik’s Boot and Nuke,
which can be quite time-consuming for larger drives. However, this
option is only feasible if the hard drive was always encrypted. If you
weren’t using full-disk encryption ahead of time, you’ll need to
overwrite the whole drive before getting rid of it.</p>

<h2>Web Browsers<a class="headerlink" href="#web-browsers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Web browsers are software on your machine that communicate with servers
or hosts on the Internet. Using a web browser causes data to be stored
on your computer and logs to be stored on the web servers you visit, and
frequently transmits unencrypted information.</p>
<p>Until you have understood
the mechanisms by which this occurs — and taken steps to prevent them —
it is best to assume that anything you do with a web browser could be
recorded by your own machine, by the web servers you’re communicating
with, or by any adversary that is able to monitor your network
connection.</p>
<div class="section" id="controlling-and-limiting-the-logs-kept-by-your-browser">
<h3>Controlling and Limiting the Logs Kept by Your Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-and-limiting-the-logs-kept-by-your-browser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Web browsers often retain a large amount of information about the way
they are used. A browser typically keeps a history of the web pages it
visits. Browsers also often retain cached copies of the pages you’ve
visited, information about which accounts you log into on web servers,
names and other data you enter into web forms, and cookies that record
preferences and link your browser to records on third party web servers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, browsers also include features for managing these records.
In general, the features are getting better, so it’s getting easier to
control browser records.</p>
<p>For example, here are the stored data privacy
settings pages for Firefox, the free web browser: <img alt="image_firefox" src="_images/firefox_privacy.jpeg" /></p>
<p>For each type of information your browser stores, you can either set it
to not collect it at all, set it to delete within a certain span of
days, set it to delete when you quit the browser, or press “clear” to
manually erase the data. Or you can “clear all” of the info — all the
data your browser’s been keeping on you.</p>
<p>Apple’s Safari browser also has
an easy one-click option to clear everything. Just select “Reset Safari”
from the “Safari” pull-down menu and you’ll get this option: <img alt="image_safari_reset" src="_images/safari_reset.jpeg" /></p>

<h3>Controlling and Limiting the Logs Kept By Web Servers<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-and-limiting-the-logs-kept-by-web-servers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Web servers usually see and retain a large amount of information about
what you do when you surf to them. For instance, if you type any
information into a form on a web page (such as a search engine), the
server will record not only what you sent it, but also information that
might identify you: your IP address, the browser and operating system
you are using, whether you followed a link from another web page to get
to the page, what that previous site/page was, your account if you are
logged in to the site, and cookies that were created when you previously
looked at pages on the site.</p>
<div class="section" id="web-privacy-is-hard">
<h4>Web Privacy is Hard<a class="headerlink" href="#web-privacy-is-hard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you use a particular website a lot, the chances are that it is going
to end up retaining a huge amount of information about you. To get a
sense of the kinds of information, and what needs to be done to prevent
them from being aggregated, read our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eff.org/wp/six-tips-protect-your-search-privacy">white paper on search privacy</a>.
Although that document primarily discusses search engines, the issues to
consider for other kinds of sites are similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cookies">
<h4>Cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#cookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a web site can send to your
browser. If your browser “accepts” them, they will be sent back to the
site every time the browser accepts a page, image or script from the
site. A cookie set by the page/site you’re visiting is a “second party”
cookie. A cookie set by another site that’s just providing an image or
script (an advertiser, for instance), is called a “third party” cookie.</p>
<p>Cookies are the most common mechanisms used to record the fact that a
particular visitor has logged in to an account on a site, and to track
the state of a multi-step transaction such as a reservation or shopping
cart purchase. As a result, it is not possible to block all cookies
without losing the ability to log into many sites and perform
transactions with others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cookies are also used for other
purposes that are less clearly in users’ interests, such as recording
their usage of a site over a long period of time, or even tracking and
correlating their visits to many separate sites (via cookies associated
with advertisements, for instance).</p>
<p>With recent browsers, the cookie
setting that offers users the most pragmatic tradeoff between
cookie-dependent functionality and privacy is to only allow cookies to
persist until the user quits the browser (also known as only allowing
“session cookies”).</p>
<p>You can enable this in the “Privacy” tab of Firefox
3’s “Preferences” pane: <img alt="image_session_cookies" src="_images/fx_session_cookies.png" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you only quit your browser entirely once every week or
two, web sites will still collect a huge amount of information about
your habits, such as the IP addresses you use at home, at work, at
friends’ houses and at Internet cafes. However, the “Incognito” mode
offered by Google’s Chrome browser and the “InPrivate” mode offered by
Internet Explorer 8 are signs that in future browsers may offer more
convenient ways to limit cookie tracking.</p>
<p>Sophisticated users can
configure their browser to manually decide whether each site they visit
is allowed to set cookies. This may have good privacy outcomes, such as
allowing session cookies for sites the user logs in to or purchases
things from, but not any other sites. But it requires a lot of work. A
certain amount of debugging may also be required for situations where
sites are poorly designed and fail to function without certain
third-party cookies.</p>

<h4>Recent Cookie-Like “Features” in Web Browsers<a class="headerlink" href="#recent-cookie-like-features-in-web-browsers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In addition to the regular cookies that web browsers send and receive,
and which users have begun to be aware of and manage for privacy,
companies have continued to implement new “features” which behave like
cookies but which aren’t managed in the same way. Adobe has created
“Local Stored Objects” (also known as “Flash Cookies”) as a part of its
Flash plug-ins; Mozilla has incorporated a feature called “DOM storage”
in recent versions of Firefox. Web sites could use either or both of
these in addition to cookies to track visitors. We recommend that users
take steps to prevent this.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Mozilla/Firefox DOM Storage
Privacy.</strong> If you use a Mozilla browser, you can disable DOM Storage
pseudo-cookies by typing <strong>about:config</strong> into the URL bar. That will
bring up an extensive list of internal browser configuration options.
Type “storage” into the filter box, and press return. You should see an
option called <strong>dom.storage.enabled</strong>. Change it to “false”.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Adobe Flash Privacy.</strong> Adobe lists advice on how to disable
Flash cookies <a class="reference external" href="http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=52697ee8&amp;sliceId=1">Flash_Cookies</a>. There are some problems with the options Adobe
offers (for instance, there is no “session only” option), so it’s
probably best to globally set Local Stored Object space to 0 and only
change that for sites which you’re willing to have tracking you. On the
Linux version of Adobe’s Flash plugin there doesn’t seem to be a way set
the limit to 0 for all sites — consider donating or contributing to the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnashdev.org/">Gnash project</a> to give users an alternative to Adobe’s
privacy-unfriendly design decisions.</p>
<p>Aside from being an annoying medium
for advertising, Flash poses other kinds of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11511">privacy and security
risks</a>. Some people choose not to use Flash at all (using other tools
like <a class="reference external" href="http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> for watching Youtube videos). Others install a Flash
management browser plugin like <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433">FlashBlocker</a>. Unfortunately, while
FlashBlocker makes surfing the web a more peaceful experience, it does
not protect you from being tracked by Flash cookies or from exposure to
other flash-based security risks.</p>

<h4>IP Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#ip-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

connected through. Use <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/search/node/SSD/Tor">Tor_SSD</a> (or a proxy server, which is faster but

<p>Most sites on the web are accessed using the unencrypted HTTP protocol.
HTTP is susceptible to eavesdropping, and even to intermediaries that
might set out to modify the pages a browser is fetching.</p>
<p>HTTPS is a more secure alternative to HTTP. HTTPS encrypts pages, and
attempts to ensure three things: (1) that third parties cannot see the
contents of the page; (2) that the page cannot be modified by third
parties; (3) that the page was really sent by the web server listed in
the URL bar. Unfortunately, a web server must be configured to support
HTTPS properly before you can use it. If there is a site you were
planning to send sensitive information to, ensure that you are using
HTTPS. If a site doesn’t support HTTPS, don’t send sensitive information
to it.</p>

that any of the security properties of the page could be broken. Contact
the site’s webmaster and have them fix the problem before sending any

<h3>Blocking Javascript for Browser Security and Privacy?<a class="headerlink" href="#blocking-javascript-for-browser-security-and-privacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Javascript is a simple programming language which is part of modern web
browsers. Unlike HTML, javascript allows a page to make the browser
perform complicated and conditional calculations in determining what a
page will look like and how it will function.</p>
<p>Javascript has many uses.
Sometimes it is simply used to make webpages look flashier by having
them respond as the mouse moves around or change themselves continually.
In other cases, javascript adds significantly to a page’s functionality,
allowing it to respond to user interactions without the need to click on
a “submit” button and wait for the web server to send back a new page in
response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, javascript also contributes to many security and privacy
problems with the web. If a malicious party can find a way to have their
javascript included in a page, they can use it for all kinds of evil:
making links change as the user clicks them; sending usernames and
passwords to the wrong places; reporting lots of information about the
users browser back to a site. Javascript is frequently a part of schemes
to track people across the web, or worse, to install <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/search/node/SSD/Malware">malware</a> on
people’s computers.</p>
<p>For this reason, sophisticated users with strict
security and privacy requirements may wish to consider selectively
blocking javascript in their browser. There is a Mozilla/Firefox plugin
called <a class="reference external" href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>which is very useful for this purpose. Noscript (1)
allows you to see the sources of any javascript in a page (many pages
include javascript from third parties); (2) blocks javascript by default
and (3) allows javascript from particular sources to be temporarily or
permanently reenabled. Surfing the web with NoScript is more work
(because when you visit new sites, you may have to enable some
javascript sources to make them work properly), but surfing the web with
NoScript is also much more secure.</p>

<div class="section" id="id14">
<h2>Wi-Fi<a class="headerlink" href="#id14" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wireless networking is now a ubiquitous means of connecting computers to
each other and to the Internet. The primary privacy concern with Wi-Fi
is the interception of the communications you send over the air. In some
cases, wireless routers might also store a small amount of information
about your computer, such as its name and the unique number assigned to
its networking card (MAC address).</p>
<p>Wireless networks are particularly
vulnerable to eavesdropping — in the end, “wireless” just means
“broadcasting your messages over the radio,” and anyone can intercept
your wireless signal unless you use encryption. Listening in on
unencrypted Wi-Fi communications is <em>easy</em>: almost any computer can do
it with simple packet-sniffing software. Special expertise or equipment
isn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Even worse, the legal protections for unencrypted
wireless communications are unclear. Law enforcement may be able to
argue that it does not need a wiretap order to intercept unencrypted
wi-fi communications because there is an exception to the rules
requiring such orders when the messages that are being intercepted are
“readily accessible to the public.” Basically, any communication over
the radio spectrum that isn’t transmitted by your phone company and
isn’t scrambled or encrypted poses a privacy risk.</p>
<div class="section" id="encrypting-a-wireless-network">
<h3>Encrypting a Wireless Network<a class="headerlink" href="#encrypting-a-wireless-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want to protect your wireless communications from the government
or anyone else, you must use encryption! Almost all wireless Internet
access points come with WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wi-Fi
Protected Access) encryption software installed to encrypt the messages
between your computer and the access point, but you have to read the
manual and figure out how to use it. WEP is not great encryption (and we
recommend strong, end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
regardless of the transmission medium), and practiced hackers can defeat
it very quickly, but it’s worth the trouble to ensure that your
communications will be entitled to the legal protections of the Wiretap
Act. WPA is much stronger than WEP, but it still only covers the first
step your packets will take across the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-using-open-wi-fi">
<h3>When Using Open Wi-Fi<a class="headerlink" href="#when-using-open-wi-fi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you’re using someone else’s “open” — unencrypted — wireless access
point, like the one at the coffee shop, you will have to take care of
your own encryption using the tools and methods described in other
sections. <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/tech/tor">Tor_Local</a> is especially useful for protecting your wireless
transmissions. If you don’t use Tor, and even if you do, you should also
always use application-level encryption over open wireless, so no one
can sniff your <a class="reference external" href="https://ssd.eff.org/your-computer/protect/passwords">passwords</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the threat of password sniffing,
it is crucially important that you do not use the same password for all
your accounts! For example, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a> requires a username
and password to log in, but the site does not use encryption. However,
web sites for banks, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">https://www.wellsfargo.com/</a>, always use
encryption due to the sensitive nature of the transactions people make
with banks. If you use the same passwords for the two sites, an
eavesdropper could see your unencrypted password traveling to the
newspaper site, and guess that you were using the same password for your
bank account.</p>
